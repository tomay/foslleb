=~=~=River Styx=~=~=
See the lion, lying in the desert sun
There are so many second hand liars in this town
That wish they were brand new again
I wish I was done
Well done

Open all night
Raging bottomless sea
Harvest the secrets to a soul
Miss merchant of melancholy

Burning brain
Fueled by desire
Going crazy for a girl like you
Is always the right thing to do

"Go play in traffic"
"Or try your backstroke on the River Styx"
To remember to forget is to remind
The pain not remembered
Is the pain left behind
Good bye

=~=~=The Coward=~=~=
He was a coward
He talked on the phone all day and explained why
He couldn’t quit his job
Tell his boss to take a hike
And just do what he always wanted to do
Besides
His girlfriend already had his whole life planned out for him
Wife, kids, a home with a white picket fence
With next door neighbors that gossiped about one another
This was his dream
What a coward
%%end%%
=~=~=Turtle=~=~=
They called him “Turtle”
Not because he was slow
I think he just felt the need to hide away
Crawl up into his shell
Get his game on alone
He tried not to let the idiots and the wanna be’s hold him down
But sooner or later peer pressure caught up and he conformed
To the alcohol
To the complacency
To the defeatist attitude that had conquered the best
Of the kindergarten firemen and astronauts
One time I caught him drunk
Slouched on a bar stool
Trying to slap girls on the ass while they passed by
Missing every time
He truly had become
The turtle
%%end%%
=~=~=Past Tense=~=~=
He hung around the skateboard park
All day
Drunk if he had enough money to splurge on a fifth
He didn’t skate
Anymore
Fresh out of jail
Continually incarcerated for bringing the rent down
In Ocean City
The kids loved him
Reckless rebel
Someone’s mom didn’t want her son to touch him with a ten-foot pole
Someone you didn’t want to smell closer than two yards away
Offensive odor
He bragged about what a bad ass he had been
In the past
A former drug gopher for the rock stars
He said he had shot up with Kurt Cobain in 91’
The “genius” without enough smarts to pull his hand out of the heroin cookie jar
This was his hero
Someone he aspired to become
When I saw him today
He was still meandering down that slow suicide slide
That took roughly five years of continual self-destruction
He thought he was cool
What an idiot
%%end%%
=~=~=Lord Byron=~=~=
He was crazy
That’s what everybody said
They had abandoned him
A modern day Lord Byron
His old girlfriend kept coming around
To let him know
She was no longer available
He left the house one afternoon in May
Took his bicycle
Leaving the door to his room ajar
I never closed it
As time went by
The things he left behind began to glow
In the middle of the night
I’d wake up
Look across the hall
His whole room on fire
I started to wonder why all those people
Were outside the hotel on Calvert Street last week
When I came home from work
My other roommate said
“Eight stories isn’t high enough to kill you”
Someone eventually helped out with identification two weeks later
At the morgue
Eight stories was high enough

Woman you were such a poor decision
You made a poor man out of me
With a queen in white linen
It is easy for a king to learn how to be a fool

Fooling around
Falling down
Like a heart tumbling off of a sleeve

The bitch in the house on the hill has no soul
This old dog in the middle of the road has no home
How did all the days and nights we stole
Run away with the fork and spoon

You would have to commission Captain Cook to look
For the treasure we left behind
And all the memories of you
Buried deep inside my mind

Into a broken heart
Where has my white egret gone
I see two birds fly
And look for the stone
That is in my heart
Not in my hand
Fool plays his cards
You are the card shark
Trapped inside the summer submarine
Of my own mind

About your grandmother
And grandfather
About your great grandmother
And great grandfather
But they don’t want you to know
Because it will poison their lies

It contains a message

My father took us to the Peter Pan Restaurant
Peacocks, chickens and other livestock ran around in the parking lot
It was a ways away from the city
I forget where
I was seven years old
It was just my father, the Colonel and me
We sat outside on the patio
The Colonel was a WWII veteran
Someone special who had fought alongside my grandfather
And made the world safe for democracy
He had cancer
I knew he didn’t have much time
In the middle of the dinner
My father pulled a gift from his coat pocket
To give to the Colonel
Of all things
It was a watch

=~=~=More Than Meets the Eye=~=~=
My father had a painting on his living room wall
It was a reproduction
Of two women looking out from a window
They appeared seductive and inviting
The painting had hung there for years
Perhaps decades
I think it was a Murillo
I never questioned it
Or looked into it
Someone came by to visit
And explained to my father
That the painting was a rendition of a prostitute and her Madame
Plying their trade at a brothel
At first my father was quite upset
"That’s absolutely absurd!"
I came by to visit
Not so long ago
There was a new starving artist painting
On the wall
And I wondered what had happened to my favorite working girls

=~=~=The Prodigal Son=~=~=
In the Rose Garden
Of the Washington Cathedral
My father showed me a statue of “The Prodigal Son”
The stone carving depicted a scene from the story
A father holding his pathetic son in his arms
“See what happens when you don’t do your homework”
My father said as I thought of all my failed second grade assignments
“See what happens when you don’t clean your room”
I thought of all my dirty underwear strewn across my bedroom floor
“Don’t you see!”
My guilt ridden face started to swell up with tears
I ask what the pathetic figure carved in stone had done
And so my father told me
“His Dad gave him a lot of money and he wasted it all”
I asked what he spent it on
“Oh things like Hostess Ho Hos and Twinkies and that sort of junk”
My father had had serious problems with his teeth and tooth decay growing up
The dentures still plagued him
He was being so candid
We sat there in silence
It was at this point in my life that I realized
There were other serious pitfalls to avoid besides
Sex, drugs and rock & roll

In a mansion on Embassy Row
Lived a friend of my grandmother
Miss Mooney
She lived alone and was divorced or widowed
Or something like that
One day she asked my mother if I would pick up sticks in her yard
Ten cents a stick
The following morning
I was in her backyard with hundreds of twigs
Piled together
As an enterprising eight year old
I was even breaking the dead branches off of her dogwood trees
She yelled out from her patio
“Would you like some hot chocolate?”
I came in from the cold
All the living room furniture was covered in white sheets
I tried to sit down in one of the chairs
“Don’t sit there!”
I jumped up like my ass had been burned by a hot waffle iron
While I drank hot chocolate
She told me about the stray cat in her garage
How she felt bad it had no home
After I left I did not see her again until Christmas Eve
My grandmother had invited her over for dinner
I asked about the cat
“The cat?”
“Oh he froze out in the garage”
I always wanted to ask her
Why she didn’t just give the poor thing one of her white sheets
To stay warm

Susan we have been looking for you
Oh so hard
Out in the marshlands
Of my own backyard
It is getting late now
Watch the sun
Move along
Past the horizon

I have come too far to twist my eyes away
Too close to Cleopatra in the pawn
In the palm
Of my own hand

Every time I get up
And feel the need to sit back down
Remind me of the golden gold
That is in the soul of a man
Who never bows
But instead wears the mark of his own crown

Susan
You are more to me
Than a broken beer bottle
Strewn around
Some drunken deer hunter's
Playground

Windy loblolly
Whisper to me now
Softly
All they say to me is
No deposit
No return

=~=~=Transient=~=~=
As a messenger in Washington DC
One of the things that provoked the most pain as well as soul searching
Was the changing geography of the job
In particular I recall deliveries to various academic institutions
One fall morning between runs
I was sitting on a bench in a Georgetown University courtyard
Watching a flood of students pour out of a building between classes
One young man with sunglasses and a baseball cap passed by
He said to another
“Someday I’m going to rule the world”
I sat back and sighed
On the bench
With my peanut butter and jelly sandwich in hand
Age twenty-seven
I had an epiphany
And muttered words to myself
“How much longer are you willing to be the errand boy for the fathers of these gold plated brats?”

=~=~=Contemplation in Newport 1991=~=~=
Lay around with nothing to think about concentrating on the good times and the bad
Isn't this marvelous asking myself "Wednesday will you go back to work?"… NO no no
At the party in the midnight hour I was thinking out loud in a crowded room
One million miles away lady don't swat a seal but wrap me up in your own fur
I ran around crying for years waiting for the sun to dry out my tears
Following the summer solstice watching the sideshow circus on the outskirts of town
Met the crazy man by the Ferris wheel who told me he was King Henry the VIII's son
What is waking me up in the morning and setting me down in the evening See the vagrants do the midnight stroll Playboys letting it all roll
Sometimes I feel so alone trying to find a method to the meaninglessness of my life
Seems I always find someone new to talk about self destructive behavior with
I wish I knew why… I wish she would move back in like the warm wind in springtime At the bar I overheard the conversation…
"He was so good to her but you can see she broke his heart like hard candy"
See how he talks to himself in the corner of the room repeating the words
"Is there still a chance we could make it?"

However everyone is a hypocrite
Hiding behind blue eyes like Eve's
With the ugly troll under the bridge

Sunshine lost in a maze
Listen to the organ player play
Playing to a black box
Moving toward a lonely grave
Rainy day, are you only the tears of his loose lover maid
Are you only the tears that his loose lover has made

Slim was fat
Obese is more accurate
He said he was a mean lean machine
When he played football for Yale
Twenty-five years ago
Aging gracefully
Did not apply to Slim
People who came by the house to visit
Commented on his condition
“You should drink a quart of orange juice every morning”
“Like my wife and me”
One Root Boy fan remarked
Slim stared at him with disgust
Dare to be fat
Was his mantra
Coffee and donuts
In the morning
Pizza around noon
Power nap afterward
Chinese food
Delivered to our doorstep in the early evening
Foster McKenzie drank Black Label and smoked Reds
All day long
He lived fast
And died in his sleep
A heart attack
At forty-six
The music magazines called him a hero in eulogy
The “Godfather of Puke”
I just thought he was lazy
And fat

When they finally let me back into your life
I felt like an old man
They needed work done on their houses
Or apartments
In exchange
“Would you make..”
“Could you paint..”
Sure I would say
I will do anything
To see you
I remember the drive through the woods to get to your condominium
Beech Drive
I thought of all my mountain bike rides
On the Rock Creek trails
Legs burning up
Brain on fire
With you constantly on my mind
When I arrived at your place
I got right to work
Smooth sailing
One time you greeted me at the door
“Hello Mister Fix Up Man”
They still had not told you
The simple truth

=~=~=The Terror of Sobriety=~=~=
Kissy was always drunk by ten
10am
He would have been drunk by nine
But the county liquor dispensary
Would not change their hours of operation
To accommodate all of his bitching
He bragged that he got more done by 9am
Than most men did all day
His wife usually chased him out of the house by noon
Told him to hit the road
One afternoon he came down my way
"My wife tells me I’m too mean to die"
"She’s right" he said and boasted some more
"I can out fuck out fight out drink any sonofabitch"
"Whatta bout you"
"Wanna sip"
He pulled a fifth of Canadian Mist from underneath the driver seat
And drank just about the whole bottle
Boy o boy
That guy sure could hold his own
I remember sitting in a bar a few months later telling some farm worker
How much of a bad-ass Kissy was
The farm worker
Finally realized who I was talking about
"Ju mean tu tell me ju didn ear"
He said
They found him in his car by one of the docks
Taking in a sunset
The means to an end
In his hand
Brains all over the dashboard
Kissy was 69

They nicknamed him “Crispy”
Like the sound and feel of newly issued hundred dollar bills
Those rascals at the surf shop would never shut up
About how disenfranchised their lives had been
In comparison to others
But it was Crispy
Who first showed me a skateboard
And turned me onto punk rock
When I was ten years old
I thought he was the coolest dude ever
But those rascals at the surf shop would not let it alone
About how Crispy lived in the gentrified part of Maryland
And not the quasi ghetto of Beecher Street with them and the rest of
Georgetown University’s alumni
I don’t think they had any idea
That Crispy came from a family of nine children
Perennially on Saturday morning
His mother and mine
Scoured every church bazaar and yard sale they could find
To put decent clothes on our backs
Crispy never wanted anyone to know his clothes were second hand
His astute dress and manner reflected this
Those two poorly attired rascals that teased him
Went on to become rock stars
Who bragged about all the skateboarding they did in junior high
They called other people posers
Who didn’t have their same
Coolness factor
Decades later
I can’t help but think that
Those rascals were the posers
Crispy was the real deal

Sitting on your grandmother’s
Wicker couch
In the living room
Feeling like an uninvited guest (perhaps I was)
At your third birthday party
It was the first time I had seen you in years
Not by choice
Twelve years later
I found a photograph your mother had snapped
Of me
Sitting there
Somehow feeling out of place
Watching you run around the living room
I felt invisible
A black hole
Ignored by all in attendance
Save for yourself
Too young to understand
Why they wanted it this way
It is hard to describe the way I felt

Not immediately anyway
Not after trying everything

To get him to face the music

He finally left town
For good
That’s what hurts now
No more waiting period
Or interval in between crossing his
Black cat path
Just gone
No sighting in
Oregon
Colorado
Or Amsterdam
Then
A rumor surfaced
That he was holed up with six vestal virgins
Somewhere on the island of Ko Chang
Just off the coast of Thailand
Binge drinking his way into paradise
Well
I’ll be a monkey’s uncle
He always did know how to party
Goodbye friend

Save a shot or scotch on the rocks for me
See you when
I retire
Give my regards to

We gazed at the art object
A heart tumbling through space
On fire
Battered and blue
Turning black
“What does it mean?” she asked
I explained that the black heart was not a bad thing
Not the harbinger of evil
Ridiculed in
Old wives tales
However
It was a symbol of temper
A process of hardening or toughening
The same way iron is smelted into steel
A trial by fire
Perhaps it was
The loss of love
Or a loved one
Burned in the inferno
A tacit understanding appeared in her eye
“How do you know the story of Blue Heart Burning Black?“
For a fleeting moment
Arose the bud
Of a memory
Long since forgotten
I held my tongue
Knowing that pain
Not remembered
Is pain
Left behind
In the spent ashes of a tempered soul

They had him laid out
On a hospital bed
All six foot five of him
The Sasquatch of Skateboarding
All jacked up
On morphine
“Is that you Monica?”
It wasn’t
It was Vivian
He was getting everyone mixed up
Several of his girlfriends had arrived
At the same time
Each thought she was the only one
His comments were delirious
“I jus luv you Monica”
I knew he was in deep trouble
Smiles were turning to frowns
I felt a catfight coming on
Just then the nurse came in
A sort of referee
“Visiting hours are over”
I walked around his feet
Sticking out from the edge of the bed
He had those silly hospital moccasins on
The girls were beginning to argue
About things jealous girls argue about
I guess he filled some pretty big shoes

Build him out of soft ribbons and bows
Someday he will walk out into this world

Hello I am this cornfield’s scarecrow
The unromantic character or so I am told
Won’t you run your fingers down my soft ribbons and bows
I would love to run away with you but it is here I set my soul

Wandering from town to town on my own two feet
Dreams lying naked between sheets
This time I was the scarecrow
Inside of a cornfield

When we will have to leave

The traveler says “Don’t sell your time to the man, man”
Wake up with the rooster
Get out on the open road
Run road runner run
Watch through the eye of the storm
See the dragon fly
Breathe volcano breathe
Watch the Sun God set
Rise full moon rise
I will dance under your moonlight sky

Tell all my frowning faces in the stranger’s town to go away

Going out bronze, lazy and insane
She said come sleep with me boy in the heart of a town where No One knows your name

=~=~=Tobacco Education=~=~=
The farm was way out
In the boonies
On the prime tobacco growing soils
Of Maryland
Known in centuries past for its good
Burning qualities
A small, independent farm that had somehow escaped
For generations
The clutches of usurping agribusiness companies
My father was working on his dissertation
Slavery In Maryland
We drove down the dirt lane
To where the farm house stood
A shack really
Built ages ago on the highest point of elevation
A man emerged
Black as the southern Maryland soil
My father talked to him for some time
As I sat in the car
The mid day sun was hot
I began to get thirsty
The farmer took us to his well
No electric pump
Only a bucket and ladle
I stood head level with the top of the cistern
He poured water into a glass
And handed it to me
Cold as ice
Before we left he gave my father a few green tobacco leaves to dry
My father was not much of a smoker
But was more interested in the tobacco drying process
From field to fire
A year or so later we returned to the tobacco farm
My father wanted to give the farmer a gift
This time the man invited us into his house
With the rest of his family
The wooden interior had a special warmth to it
We sat at the dining room table
In the center of the tiny room
As a sort of thank you for sharing his time
My father pulled a book from his pants pocket
And handed it to the farmer
The farmer stared in bewilderment at the cover of the paperback
Politely thanked my father
Then slowly set the book down on the table
My father looked somewhat faint
Color ran out of his pale face
As if he had abruptly come to some stark realization
Or barrier
Of written word
I felt a furrow opening up
Wide
Like a canyon
We said our goodbyes
On the way home I asked my father what the title of the book was
He muttered
History of Black Americans
Driving North
We fell silent
I could not yet read but still wondered why
My father gave him
A book of complicated words
Neither the farmer
Nor my father
Could ever understand

Pouring into deep blue eyes

Sewn together in a kiss

Bob’s face had become
Synonymous with the Georgetown Theater
The lines on his forehead
Engraved by decades of disingenuously using the words
“Thank you”
He worked the ticket booth
I was his apprentice
The ticket ripper
He tried
In earnest
To teach me the finer points of being a theater usher
The correct method of holding the door open
For patrons
And so forth
In 1961 he held the door open
For President Kennedy (“And his date--shhh!” Bob said this was confidential)
On Jack’s way in to see a live performance of the play
Death of a Salesman
This was the high point of his career
Five shows a day of the x-rated Roman epic
Caligula
Was the current fare
Even so
This was not enough to save the antiquated movie house
According to Bob
The theater
Had come a long way from its former glory
One winter day
Between shows
He told me the dreadful news
“Gus says they finally found a buyer.”
“They're gonna gut this place like a fish”
“And turn it into a jewelry outlet”
“Imagine that”
“The end of an empire”
Bob was getting pretty worked up
I detected a tear in his eye
“You don’t even seem to care!”
I just sat there
On the heater
Dressed up in the usher's red monkey suit
Looking through the large glass door
At cars passing by on Wisconsin Avenue
Wishing I was somewhere else
For once
Bob was right

Sometimes I feel I should just let it all go
Then again
I know
It’s nothing six thousand years of men
Haven’t had to face before
I’m going to stay strong
When I feel the fall
I’m going to hang on

There is a siren
Sitting on the other side of the lake
Singing her irresistible song
Wickedly tempting and inviting mistakes

Dripping wet outstretched arms
Tempestuously
Offering me seductive fruit
Then again
I know what I’ve got to do

The grass looks green on the other side
Then again
I know
It’s all in my mind
Coming to realize
Peripeteia
Paradise is found deceptively concealed
Quietly masquerading
As an ordinary thing
I stumble upon
At a seemingly uneventful
Time in my life
Goodbye dagger hiding behind an insidious smile
I have fortunately broken away

And within ten minutes
She dropped more names on me

Silent
Nodding every so often
Taking it all in
Trying not to look bored
I knew everyone she spoke of
Anyway
But didn’t let on
Besides
She was really getting into it
Her face was red and puffy
All worked up
The saga went on
And on
“…I think they’re getting married once the divorce is final”
And on
But here’s (in my opinion) where her thesis got complicated:
“...and she says he has to put that silly skateboard back in the closet”
“And spend more quality time with her, that’ll learn him. I couldn’t agree more!”
Boy oh boy

Cheer up mister man dans la lune
I've got a riddle for you:
Anyone who turned their back on love
Wouldn't shed his light on me
He would cower away from life
And sit sulking in a dimly lit room
Somewhere on the dark side of the moon

And that's not you
or me
Goodbye Dorothy

Write another song for me
When I’m gone
Rolling down the road
To no one ever knows

Jesus was just another lost soul
You met on your way
Somehow miscast in the play
Running away
Kicking around
Another loose stone on the ground

Girl we’re never going to make it
If we don’t try
Look into blue eyes
See Adam
See Eve
So much hardship and misery
You and me
And adversity
Our own personal trinity

Wasted
Blown away
By the trials of life
Drugs
Alcohol
Divorce
More drugs
Things he wished he could
Forget
It had been over twenty years
Since I last saw him
A sadness
Or sense of loss
Filled his eyes
I talked about old times
And the days of yore
Wasted
In our misspent youth
“Remember when...”
I went on at length
About
All the beautiful
Girls in our high school class
Fist Fights
In the locker room
And the general mayhem
Associated with our adolescence
“Remember!”
He stared with tired eyes
Looking right through me
Because he couldn't recall
Twenty more years of
Backsliding down the road
Had not been kind
To his memory

=~=~=Little Sister=~=~=
Goodbye summertime
So long warm breeze
Whistling through my hair
Here comes the winter's
Killing freeze
Green fields are a frozen memory
Sleeping under a blanket of snow
Is it conceivable to die
I guess
Only the dead really know
Does it really matter anyway
If I ever knew you or you ever knew me
Only time will tell
A little piece
Of the puzzle in me
Written into you
Puts a little peace and wonder
Back into my heart
Will I ever see you again
Remember when you were
Running like a kite in the wind
I struggled to hold on and then
Something happened I still can't understand
You slipped right through my hands
Sweet snowflake
Whispering in my ear
Gently calling out from your falling star
Little Sister
Little Sister
All the while
The North wind blows
Goodbye summertime
Put a tear back in my eye
It's time to pick up sticks
And face the cold
Alone

In trying to get back in touch with you

Would you even recognize

Duck and Heron
The nursery rhyme
And adult fairy tale
Sitting by the edge of the water
I am reminded of the
Meaningless stuff of
The old hermit in the woods
That lonely loveless man
Lacking in connection

Dashing knight of Sir Thomas Malory
Unable to see
The forest through the trees
Do you see the pretty girl
Caught in the snare of the city
Another lost snowy white egret
Pasted into the cold and dark landscape
Of relentless concrete

Duck and Heron
Together again
Sleeping on the edge of the bay
Beautiful white egret
Yearning to spread your wings
Dreaming of escape
If you are alone
Fly back toward me
Slip away
I am singing your song
Listen...
Can you hear me call

She was going a little berserk
Like most women do
In the morning
At the end of the month
So I walked out
Away from the turmoil
Into the cold city air
"Here's what you get!"
The spiteful message she sent
Specified that
Only a friendship could be salvaged
From the wreckage
Of our relationship
The love affair
So full of passion and life
Was now extinct
A fragile flower that had bloomed too soon
Met with a late spring freeze
And died
When I finally saw her again
I told her I already
Had enough friends
Shook her hand
And walked away
Back toward Lovers Lane
To spin the roulette wheel
One more time
Again

He felt like he had gotten old
After tripping
Running for the ferryboat
Only to miss
Helplessly watching it roll on down
The river without him
An overwelming feeling
That somehow life had passed him
By
Came over him
Where was Saint Nick now
To tell him to quit whinning
And enjoy life
All his heroes had disappeared
While watching the river flow
The fat old man with the long grey
Beard
Sitting next to him on the pier
Sat back
Basking in the summer sun
Laughing
While the young man cried
The stout old man asked him
"Where do you think Santa Claus goes in the summer time?"

What the stressed out
Cosmopolitan urban girl gave me
Would have killed another man
Her disease
Passed down
From a previous romantic
Catastrophe
Plagued her life with a dark
Sadness
I tried to help her
With laughter
Companionship
And a sympathetic ear
To listen to her rant
About her crummy
Office job
And the dodgy politics
Associated with it
About her millionaire ex-husband
Jilting her
And their messy divorce
About how she didn't know
What to do
With the rest of her
Insatiable life
Soon I was too close
To escape contracting
Her great depression
Of lonliness
Despair
And a fear of things to come
She passed it on
To me
Like a hot potato
I consumed it
And after our affair was over
What she gave me
Began to burn
And simmer
Inside
I had been had
Sold a clunker
At first the disease was
Manageable
Not a big deal
By the end I was bed ridden
And unable to sleep
Losing interest in things
Alone
With the neverending thought
That there was only darkness at
The end
Of the tunnel
My salvation came
At the hands of a small town
Country girl
Who offered the future
Of a simple life
Uncomplicated by the turmoil
Nonsense
And sickness
Of my past
Wise beyond her years
She wanted nothing in return

=~=~=Joyce's Modernist Portrait=~=~=
James Joyce’s <i>A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man</i>, Thomas Carlyle’s <i>Sartor Resartus</i> and Charles Bukowski’s <i>Factotum</i> all share autobiographical protagonists. In <i>A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man</i>, Joyce’s protagonist, Stephen Dedalus, searches for an escape from the confines of family, religion, Irish nationalism and poverty. Thomas Carlyle’s hero Diogenes Teufelsdrockh goes through cycles of despair eventually finding enlightenment. Charles Bukowski’s hero in his novel <i>Factotum</i>, Henry Chinaski, struggles with alcoholism, poverty and alienation from society. Carlyle’s novel was written during the Victorian era and Bukowski’s <i>Factotum</i> is centered in Los Angeles during the 1940’s. Joyce’s novel takes place around Dublin in the early 20th century. The characters of both Diogenes Teufelsdrockh and Henry Chinaski share many uncanny similarities with Joyce’s Modernist alter-ego, Stephen Dedalus. One of the biggest similarities these three characters share is their unconscious drive toward isolation and alienation from society in pursuit of artistry.

=~=~=Symbolism and Hints of Autobiography in The Great Gatsby and Tender is the Night=~=~=
F. Scott Fitzgerald's <i>The Great Gatsby</i> and <i>Tender is the Night</i> share protagonists whose love affairs end in catastrophe. Jay Gatsby's romance with Daisy Buchanan shatters when Gatsby's platonic ideal of love collides with reality. Similarly, Dick Diver's romantic tryst, outside of marriage, hastens his downfall and descent into alcoholism. Fitzgerald's ideas about American decay in the aftermath of World War I are played through Jay Gatsby, and Dick Diver. Gatsby's endless desire for Daisy and his ideas about reliving a past that cannot be retrieved mirror the disillusionment of post-war America. Diver's desires for the young Rosemary Hoyt are benign so long as they are not acted upon. Fitzgerald's juxtaposition of the platonic ideals of love and the problems of actualizing love become enacted in the characters of Gatsby and Diver, especially in their yearnings to materialize what is outside space and time.

"Besides..
Management made him an offer

So now he has to quit slumming it
As a starving artist"
"Wow" I said scratching my head
Astonished at the monumental
Paradigm shift that
Had occurred in our friend's life

"It's quite a trade off you know..
Everything was going along ok
Before they got married
But now she wants to buy into

And become a Unitarian"
Still puzzled I said
"You mean utilitarian..
As in robot.. right?"

"Yeah whatever..I'm just letting you
Know that we've lost one of our own

=~=~=Cereno=~=~=
The Encantadas, Herman Melville’s collection of ten sketches contains various stories of human interaction with the Galapagos Islands. The relationship the whalers, merchants and buccaneers have with the inhospitable landscape and sparsely populated wildlife of this "Enchanted Ground" soon develops into the beginnings of human colonization. Melville's novella, Benito Cerano, also tells the story of colonization and the trafficking of slaves. While Melville's The Encantadas relates stories of exploration on the newfound territory of the Galapagos Islands, Benito Cerano takes place on board ships which have yet to reach their destinations. By juxtaposing the actions of Melville's early settlers on land in The Encantadas with the ideologies contained on board the American and Spanish sailing vessels in Melville's Benito Cereno, it becomes evident that the colonization of new lands is only an extension of the ideologies and laws of domination contained on board the ships that encounter them. This natural tendency to colonize leads to the use and exploitation of resources as well as the domination and enslavement of other human beings regardless of ethnicity.

Fabricated by witchcraft

Men who are doormats
Beget adulteress wives

A quasi "Cosmopolitan" woman
Wrecking your home
Who complains about the food

=~=~=The Sinister and the Supernatural in Macbeth=~=~=
William Shakespeare’s play Macbeth contains elements of the supernatural and witchcraft in its portrayal of a Scottish war hero’s lust for power. By incorporating elements of magic, Shakespeare’s classic tragedy has become, perhaps, his most controversial play. Shakespeare uses the darker themes of Paganism and the occult to show how Macbeth is corrupted from a revered general in the service of King Duncan into a power-hungry murderer and tyrant. The play contrasts Macbeth’s faith in the supernatural with Christian themes, to explain how Macbeth has gone so radically astray from his initial honorable qualities as a warrior in the service of King Duncan.

=~=~=Emerson’s Influence on the Rebel Thoreau=~=~=
The writings of Ralph Waldo Emerson celebrate the importance of original thought and were the foundation of the early-American Transcendentalist movement. Emerson's theories also had a profound influence on Henry David Thoreau and Thoreau's creation of Walden. In “The Transcendentalist” Emerson divides the “thinkers” of the world into two sects, Materialists and Idealists. Emerson observes that materialists are of a less refined sect than idealists who contend that their way of thinking is higher in nature. This concept--that ideas belong to a more perfect order than things--is central to Emerson’s philosophy. He also notes that to achieve this sort of thought process the idealist is better suited in a communion with nature than with society. Although Emerson’s ideas about Transcendentalism were well grounded in theory they had yet to be tested in the real world. Henry David Thoreau’s writings about his experiences of solitude (in a cabin situated on acreage Emerson owned) and his quest for inner peace culminated in Walden. Emerson’s ideas about isolation, brought on by a rejection from the utilitarian world, forcing the idealist into a contemplative, more perfect state of mind, unencumbered by the clutter and chatter of the materialist life he has left behind, were put into motion by Thoreau and his desire to live amongst nature. It was through this tempering process, of rejection and isolation from society, that the Idealist in Thoreau finally emerged, committed to the perfection of these ideas. Thoreau’s decision to reintegrate himself back into society and to share the thoughts of his new found idealism after his completion of Walden show Thoreau’s transition from misunderstood rebel to a spokesman for Individualism. By sharing his experiences in Walden, Thoreau takes on Emerson’s challenge that the contemporary Transcendentalist must go forth into the same world which at first shunned him to share his new found spiritualism completing a cycle beginning with Thoreau being a shunned outcast and culminating in his writing of Walden.

=~=~=Dear Facebook Lover=~=~=
Dear Facebook Lover,

I have been utterly fascinated by your creative and dramatic letters of late…

"I had a dream the other night that you were attempting to beat up a male friend of mine. I tried to break it up, stared you in the eyes and asked you if you were going to hit me instead. That says a lot."

That dream sounds pretty rotten, and I would like to investigate some of its hidden meanings through further analysis. Needless to say, dreams are not real--and there is certainly no validity whatsoever to this one. A prominent trait of borderline personality disorder rears its ugly head when a person associated with this illness disassociates and deludes events in their own mind to construct their own reality--somewhat equivalent to believing in the Easter Bunny—even when no eggs are found during the egg hunt—very disconcerting. Most people with this disorder embark on character distortions and smear campaigns against their targets, armed with only these sorts of "delusional feelings" they have turned into facts to poop all over people that refuse to buy into their manipulation. Wow!--your dream is a textbook example which shows the process, from its inception by which the fabrication of mistruths are constructed in such a way that the person who formulates events of unreality actually believes them--magnificent--I bet a number of prominent psychiatrists would pay good money to have witnessed this elusive "process" of cognitive distortion you have just shed more light on! Furthermore, those who engage in the defamation of another person’s character should be held accountable for their irresponsible behavior and forced to sit strapped in a Lay-Z-Boy chair watching reruns of “The Bachelor” and “Cougar Town,” while repeating the words “I will never tell a lie” 30000 times.

Oh…(I almost forgot) about your dream...With my background in dream analysis and astrology I feel that a Freudian deconstruction of your dream would reveal that: at some point in a former relationship you had cheated with said male "friend" on a boyfriend or husband and felt a tremendous amount of guilt and shame after which you offered yourself up as a "sacrificial lamb" to amend the damage done by your own actions--finally taking full responsibility (by not blaming anyone else for your own misdeeds). Congratulations!!--this is a huge step forward… Now...what I've outlined is only what Freud's "dream theory" would suppose--but I suggest you consult a therapist (but please...not that lady you pay that rewards you with complements for your own bad-girl randy behavior) for an absolute "expert" opinion on this matter.

Because I was never properly introduced to any of your "friends" (isolating me was better for control...I guess...right? That way no one would ever know who I actually was—all the better to impugn my character—very tactful!) I find it hard to comment on your dream. Was the "male friend" someone you were cheating with during our relationship?--it's pretty hard to figure...That wacky dream could also be a result of the sleeping pills you take-- decreased serotonin levels resulting from past candy flipping abuse during your wild San Francisco party days (with Devilboy?--I recall the exciting stories you told me about roll-playing "Paradise Lost" with him while you were all spun out) could also be a cause--there is a link between low serotonin levels contributing to sleep disorders—No wonder no one sleeps at a techno party--mystery revealed.

I know you have had some old bad-boy "friends" who you said were in trouble with the law (I certainly never have been) and I sincerely hope you are not currently involved with someone who has a history of that sort of behavior (fighting over women)—Please! That is so passé and I must admit that it sounds a bit ridiculous--Do you really think someone with your character is worth fighting, (even arm wrestling) over? (LOL) That says a lot girlfriend--sounds pretty narcissistic on your end--perhaps your therapist could help you address this disorder (NPD) as well. In the any case I, personally, am soo thankful to not have contracted any cooties from you and your dealings--thanks for sharing those VJ test results with me before you left to go on vacation with your folks in Florida—I remember your face joyously lighting up with your exuberant exclamation of "looks like we're both clean!"--Thank God! I must also thank you for using the condoms I accidentally uncovered in your bed stand drawer (next to your "Joy of Sex" instruction book and your treasured Anais Nin autobiography in the “classics” section of your secret bookcase) over Valentine's Day weekend--one week before our relationship bit the dust. OMG! I cannot thank you enough for being responsible and “safe” whenever and wherever any shagging was taking place—I am thoroughly grateful.

By the way, Bob is doing well and inquired about you recently: "What ever happened to that whack job chick anyway?" I told him not to prematurely judge you by your "weirdness" on your final day at my house (he witnessed the whole thing). He remembers how much you were raging all night in my room, screaming about missing your horny and frustrated ex-boyfriends (the ones you said you were still in communication with on FB--remember?) and husband--who you were committing adultery on (did he ever hold you accountable--just curious...)--I always felt bad for the way that guy remained under the seat of your outhouse waiting to receive your next emission--he really must have been your loyal-royal doormat to put up with that sort of raunchy behavior from you during your marriage--my mother once commented to me about that--"if she treated him like garbage she’s going to treat you like garbage"—well… (needless to say) you should always listen to Mom's wisdom..I guess hindsight is 20/20.

On a different note, I too must also confess of a dream I had recently...In the dream you and another special "friend" (a gringo-loving Juan Valdez lookalike who was having an affair with you) were driving to the airport. To make this fella feel uneasy and jealous you gave me (your old boyfriend) a call. This sort of triangular manipulation is, typically, pretty successful when "bedding down" a male--especially when implemented with precision by a femme fatal as I know firsthand...I remember when you did the same thing to me while we were driving to the beach, by calling--just to "check in"--with one of your old BMX buddies--I think his name was Bike--you know--that former lover of yours--you said was addicted to crack and had just been released from prison?--the one you mentioned needing to babysit for while his girlfriend was out of town over that fated Valentine's Day weekend...after I had traveled 7 hours up to see you--that's a pretty inappropriate and hurtful thing to say to your boyfriend huh-- I must admit it did make feel like emasculated silly puddy--being a captive audience and all, to you and your "friend's" conversation--not because I was jealous but because I was sort of surprised by your indiscretion in choices made when it came to former lovers (and prison inmates for that matter). Ok… back to the dream...yeah...like I said--this dude you were "bedding down" was a captive audience inside the car with you and could not escape listening (very clever on your part) to what (I thought) was "our" private conversation--In this dream I was working on my M.A. when you called--so...when I finally figured out (after about 3 minutes) that there was another one of your male "friends" I was being triangulated with (he was softly whistling in the background to make himself heard though the phone, perhaps to let me know that he was the latest "catch" in your succubus dragnet), I simply said (to you) that I needed to finish reading the dictionary and quickly hung up the phone before anymore toxic, manipulative sludge could be spewed out of the party line receiver onto me--That's when I suddenly woke up feeling like I needed an immediate shower to wash off. Well...pretty unusual dream huh?

I must also apologize for deleting you from FB. I love Facebook-- Even though too many attention-seekers use it to start emotional affairs without their current partner's knowledge--as a backup for when said lover "walks out" after he can no longer stand the unhealthy drama queen behavior dished out in the form of projective, emotional rage ("projection" is when a person accuses someone else of doing exactly what they themselves are trying to hide--like when you accused me of cheating during our relationship--to validate the failings of character you yourself were engaging in with AFC who lived down the street from you in Dirtihippiville)--don't you agree?--FB is where you reconnected with me before you took off your wedding ring--claiming your husband was impotent--and had doomed you to a life of sexual frustration—remember?—You made me feel like such a shinning, white knight on that moonlit equinox night... Anyway...my girlfriend somehow managed to delete you (sorry) from FB after I stepped away from my computer for a brief moment--very immature (I know). She's much younger than you and loves to garden and roll in the hay--she waters the veggies and I water the bush--so please give her a break.

Generally my age limit for girlfriends is about 35--I made an extreme exception for you in my life because of our previous relationship 20 years prior (Alas, those spoiled rotten days of recklessly driving your father's Ferrari on the streets of zip code 90210 are gone forever) when you ran out on me to join hands with another guy you said was being released from "the can"--boy did that hurt--oh well..What is it with you and prisoners anyway? Wait... don't tell me--it's that they are under lock and key and can't run away or abandon you--yet (being captive) they can't really develop intimacy either--pure genius--that addresses two of your biggest fears--abandonment and intimacy—what a catch-22. That said, I am currently not looking to date anyone over 40--women at the age of perimenopause (and menopause for that matter) can be tremendously challenging for all those involved especially when combined with other BPD symptoms and PMS rage--"No fun my babe" as your friend Iggy Pop would say... Please know that you and any "friends" (male or otherwise) will always be welcome down here as cow-dung shoveling interns (however, this is entirely contingent upon your successful completion of DBT therapy). I can definitely throw in a small stipend as well.

O.K… back to the character assassinations and smear campaigns...geez… Not sure how to approach this one…I can wholeheartedly say that I am extremely sorry to have joined the club of your dismembered ex's (even if I still do have my balls intact) that you have defamed to successfully portray yourself as a damsel in distress to attract the next "victim" you are currently feeding on in your perpetual Karpman Love Triangle. I know it comes as quite a shock for you to discover that I've known about your trashy behavior (and all the fibs you told me) all along--Snooki of "Jersey Shore" would be proud of you--but you'll get use to that eventually...it's ok—I have forgiven you... I guess by acknowledging the truth about our relationship (and your infidelity) it goes a long way to disprove some of the things you may be telling other people about "us" and our relationship's demise. Its difficult to play the victim when people know the real story…Right? Try working on yourself--get out there and make the most of the day for a change Supergirl!

It sounds like there’s still a variety of quirkiness in your life that you may want to smooth over—even if it’s at the expense of mentally torturing your next soul mate into believing he is the one at fault for causing all the grief and misfortune in your own life. I’ll be thanking my lucky stars when it’s him and not me the next time you’ve got him by the gonads, forcing him to scream while he does your dirty dishes: “The Greek goddess Ate is my Drama Queen and I’m her eternal slave!!”—Argh—I’m getting a migraine just thinking about it. As I say—its all water under the bridge and there are no hard feelings. I just wanted to let you know--the jig is up (it always was). I know perfectly well who you really are underneath your cleverly seductive facade--albeit aging--please try your hardest not to let it fade as it is your greatest asset for sucking new, unsuspecting males into your web for emotional drainage.

I'm so glad we have made amends and have forgiven one another! However, contact with you from now on will only be contingent upon your successful completion of Dialectical Behavior Therapy (DBT) to adjust some of the toxic and hurtful ways you have adopted for dealing with people--especially those you are intimate with. This therapy works wonders for emotional vampires, who are afflicted with the traits of borderline personality disorder. Good Luck--I know you can do it! It is so important for your own well-being and happiness. I would be proud to be your friend on Facebook again if (but only if) you are successful with DBT and are able to conquer the (BPD) demon within--As your Dad's cousin famously said to you--out of the blue-- while we ate Xmas dinner together at your parent's house: "W.eird S.ister…when are you going to stop doing this to your father?" Well…I must say that I really did not understand what he meant at the time--now I'm sure I do.

Please know that I will always hold you in high regard--even if I refuse to let you brainwash and manipulate me like a piece of wet pottery.

Keep painting yourself into a corner and stay in denial—You’re doing a terrific job Trixie!

P.S. Give my regards to all my friends in Hollywood especially my favorite Narcissist/Borderline couple--the Adam and Eve of America--Brad and Anjelina!

Cheers!

=~=~=Reflection=~=~=
Oh... the many thoughts
That traverse across the
Landscape..
On a long walk
I found a river of you and I
Filled with curiosities
And things I failed to understand..
Abandonment fears
Of
Childhood dreams
Which we both shared
And the stark nightmare
Of rejection
By loved ones
And those we held dear

I remember the wonderful
Strung out days
High on
Idealization
The beginning...
In places together
I felt akin to you
An endless belief
In things to come
Stolen by the intangible
Doubts and fears
We superimposed
Upon each other..
These were our greatest fears--
Realized
But still
Only perceived...
Those thoughts of unease
Never existed...
Really
In reality
%%end%%
=~=~=Early Morning Thoughts and Ideas=~=~=
Live As You Please
What an incredible notion
Nothing to hold you
Down
I knew from the start
That deep inside my heart
Somehow I would eventually find
A way to peace of mind
Walk on all this way
And finally find a place to stay
Down inside my heart
Write it
In stone
Having tried to walk away
For so long
I've walked far
But it seems that
I've been here before
Round and round again
Any sort of separation begins to end
Something forefathers put
Out on loan
These things are carved in stone
Like in Movies
I look out the window
Out into the street
Another exit into
A different ground under my feet
I'd like to reach out
To you my long lost friend
But I'm so afraid to begin again
Within Time
Sometimes I wish I could go back
In time
The attraction
And idealization of a memory
Is so perfect
Uncorrupted and disabused
On the interior of a mind
When I've done as much as I can
Will I have only these memories
Washed away
After Rain
We try as hard as we can
And still sometimes the scales
Do not tip our way
Feeling washed away
Over promises I broke
To others and to myself
Lover--please don't paint me black
For the rest of our lives
Sometimes it's better to walk away
And leave what is left
Off White

=~=~=Soulmate=~=~=
There is no One
There are lots of Them
Don't fall for the myth
She tries to snake charm you with
Be not afraid
To lose
There are lots of only
1's

Cruising down the road
Aren't we both listening to
The same song on the radio
Softly playing in
The back of my mind
Some old
Slow
Psychedelic
Never played before
Tune...
My dream band of
Jimi, Jaco and Keith Moon
