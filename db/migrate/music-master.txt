=~=~=River Styx=~=~=
See the lion, lying in the desert sun
There are so many second hand liars in this town
That wish they were brand new again
I wish I was done
Well done

Open all night
Raging bottomless sea
Harvest the secrets to a soul
Miss merchant of melancholy

Burning brain
Fueled by desire
Going crazy for a girl like you
Is always the right thing to do

"Go play in traffic"
"Or try your backstroke on the River Styx"
To remember to forget is to remind
The pain not remembered
Is the pain left behind
Good bye

=~=~=The Coward=~=~=
He was a coward
He talked on the phone all day and explained why
He couldn’t quit his job
Tell his boss to take a hike
And just do what he always wanted to do
Besides
His girlfriend already had his whole life planned out for him
Wife, kids, a home with a white picket fence
With next door neighbors that gossiped about one another
This was his dream
What a coward
%%end%%
=~=~=Turtle=~=~=
They called him “Turtle”
Not because he was slow
I think he just felt the need to hide away
Crawl up into his shell
Get his game on alone
He tried not to let the idiots and the wanna be’s hold him down
But sooner or later peer pressure caught up and he conformed
To the alcohol
To the complacency
To the defeatist attitude that had conquered the best
Of the kindergarten firemen and astronauts
One time I caught him drunk
Slouched on a bar stool
Trying to slap girls on the ass while they passed by
Missing every time
He truly had become
The turtle
%%end%%
=~=~=Past Tense=~=~=
He hung around the skateboard park
All day
Drunk if he had enough money to splurge on a fifth
He didn’t skate
Anymore
Fresh out of jail
Continually incarcerated for bringing the rent down
In Ocean City
The kids loved him
Reckless rebel
Someone’s mom didn’t want her son to touch him with a ten-foot pole
Someone you didn’t want to smell closer than two yards away
Offensive odor
He bragged about what a bad ass he had been
In the past
A former drug gopher for the rock stars
He said he had shot up with Kurt Cobain in 91’
The “genius” without enough smarts to pull his hand out of the heroin cookie jar
This was his hero
Someone he aspired to become
When I saw him today
He was still meandering down that slow suicide slide
That took roughly five years of continual self-destruction
He thought he was cool
What an idiot
%%end%%
=~=~=Lord Byron=~=~=
He was crazy
That’s what everybody said
They had abandoned him
A modern day Lord Byron
His old girlfriend kept coming around
To let him know
She was no longer available
He left the house one afternoon in May
Took his bicycle
Leaving the door to his room ajar
I never closed it
As time went by
The things he left behind began to glow
In the middle of the night
I’d wake up
Look across the hall
His whole room on fire
I started to wonder why all those people
Were outside the hotel on Calvert Street last week
When I came home from work
My other roommate said
“Eight stories isn’t high enough to kill you”
Someone eventually helped out with identification two weeks later
At the morgue
Eight stories was high enough

Woman you were such a poor decision
You made a poor man out of me
With a queen in white linen
It is easy for a king to learn how to be a fool

Fooling around
Falling down
Like a heart tumbling off of a sleeve

The bitch in the house on the hill has no soul
This old dog in the middle of the road has no home
How did all the days and nights we stole
Run away with the fork and spoon

You would have to commission Captain Cook to look
For the treasure we left behind
And all the memories of you
Buried deep inside my mind

Into a broken heart
Where has my white egret gone
I see two birds fly
And look for the stone
That is in my heart
Not in my hand
Fool plays his cards
You are the card shark
Trapped inside the summer submarine
Of my own mind

About your grandmother
And grandfather
About your great grandmother
And great grandfather
But they don’t want you to know
Because it will poison their lies

It contains a message

My father took us to the Peter Pan Restaurant
Peacocks, chickens and other livestock ran around in the parking lot
It was a ways away from the city
I forget where
I was seven years old
It was just my father, the Colonel and me
We sat outside on the patio
The Colonel was a WWII veteran
Someone special who had fought alongside my grandfather
And made the world safe for democracy
He had cancer
I knew he didn’t have much time
In the middle of the dinner
My father pulled a gift from his coat pocket
To give to the Colonel
Of all things
It was a watch

=~=~=More Than Meets the Eye=~=~=
My father had a painting on his living room wall
It was a reproduction
Of two women looking out from a window
They appeared seductive and inviting
The painting had hung there for years
Perhaps decades
I think it was a Murillo
I never questioned it
Or looked into it
Someone came by to visit
And explained to my father
That the painting was a rendition of a prostitute and her Madame
Plying their trade at a brothel
At first my father was quite upset
"That’s absolutely absurd!"
I came by to visit
Not so long ago
There was a new starving artist painting
On the wall
And I wondered what had happened to my favorite working girls

=~=~=The Prodigal Son=~=~=
In the Rose Garden
Of the Washington Cathedral
My father showed me a statue of “The Prodigal Son”
The stone carving depicted a scene from the story
A father holding his pathetic son in his arms
“See what happens when you don’t do your homework”
My father said as I thought of all my failed second grade assignments
“See what happens when you don’t clean your room”
I thought of all my dirty underwear strewn across my bedroom floor
“Don’t you see!”
My guilt ridden face started to swell up with tears
I ask what the pathetic figure carved in stone had done
And so my father told me
“His Dad gave him a lot of money and he wasted it all”
I asked what he spent it on
“Oh things like Hostess Ho Hos and Twinkies and that sort of junk”
My father had had serious problems with his teeth and tooth decay growing up
The dentures still plagued him
He was being so candid
We sat there in silence
It was at this point in my life that I realized
There were other serious pitfalls to avoid besides
Sex, drugs and rock & roll

In a mansion on Embassy Row
Lived a friend of my grandmother
Miss Mooney
She lived alone and was divorced or widowed
Or something like that
One day she asked my mother if I would pick up sticks in her yard
Ten cents a stick
The following morning
I was in her backyard with hundreds of twigs
Piled together
As an enterprising eight year old
I was even breaking the dead branches off of her dogwood trees
She yelled out from her patio
“Would you like some hot chocolate?”
I came in from the cold
All the living room furniture was covered in white sheets
I tried to sit down in one of the chairs
“Don’t sit there!”
I jumped up like my ass had been burned by a hot waffle iron
While I drank hot chocolate
She told me about the stray cat in her garage
How she felt bad it had no home
After I left I did not see her again until Christmas Eve
My grandmother had invited her over for dinner
I asked about the cat
“The cat?”
“Oh he froze out in the garage”
I always wanted to ask her
Why she didn’t just give the poor thing one of her white sheets
To stay warm

Susan we have been looking for you
Oh so hard
Out in the marshlands
Of my own backyard
It is getting late now
Watch the sun
Move along
Past the horizon

I have come too far to twist my eyes away
Too close to Cleopatra in the pawn
In the palm
Of my own hand

Every time I get up
And feel the need to sit back down
Remind me of the golden gold
That is in the soul of a man
Who never bows
But instead wears the mark of his own crown

Susan
You are more to me
Than a broken beer bottle
Strewn around
Some drunken deer hunter's
Playground

Windy loblolly
Whisper to me now
Softly
All they say to me is
No deposit
No return

=~=~=Transient=~=~=
As a messenger in Washington DC
One of the things that provoked the most pain as well as soul searching
Was the changing geography of the job
In particular I recall deliveries to various academic institutions
One fall morning between runs
I was sitting on a bench in a Georgetown University courtyard
Watching a flood of students pour out of a building between classes
One young man with sunglasses and a baseball cap passed by
He said to another
“Someday I’m going to rule the world”
I sat back and sighed
On the bench
With my peanut butter and jelly sandwich in hand
Age twenty-seven
I had an epiphany
And muttered words to myself
“How much longer are you willing to be the errand boy for the fathers of these gold plated brats?”

=~=~=Contemplation in Newport 1991=~=~=
Lay around with nothing to think about concentrating on the good times and the bad
Isn't this marvelous asking myself "Wednesday will you go back to work?"… NO no no
At the party in the midnight hour I was thinking out loud in a crowded room
One million miles away lady don't swat a seal but wrap me up in your own fur
I ran around crying for years waiting for the sun to dry out my tears
Following the summer solstice watching the sideshow circus on the outskirts of town
Met the crazy man by the Ferris wheel who told me he was King Henry the VIII's son
What is waking me up in the morning and setting me down in the evening See the vagrants do the midnight stroll Playboys letting it all roll
Sometimes I feel so alone trying to find a method to the meaninglessness of my life
Seems I always find someone new to talk about self destructive behavior with
I wish I knew why… I wish she would move back in like the warm wind in springtime At the bar I overheard the conversation…
"He was so good to her but you can see she broke his heart like hard candy"
See how he talks to himself in the corner of the room repeating the words
"Is there still a chance we could make it?"

However everyone is a hypocrite
Hiding behind blue eyes like Eve's
With the ugly troll under the bridge

Sunshine lost in a maze
Listen to the organ player play
Playing to a black box
Moving toward a lonely grave
Rainy day, are you only the tears of his loose lover maid
Are you only the tears that his loose lover has made

Slim was fat
Obese is more accurate
He said he was a mean lean machine
When he played football for Yale
Twenty-five years ago
Aging gracefully
Did not apply to Slim
People who came by the house to visit
Commented on his condition
“You should drink a quart of orange juice every morning”
“Like my wife and me”
One Root Boy fan remarked
Slim stared at him with disgust
Dare to be fat
Was his mantra
Coffee and donuts
In the morning
Pizza around noon
Power nap afterward
Chinese food
Delivered to our doorstep in the early evening
Foster McKenzie drank Black Label and smoked Reds
All day long
He lived fast
And died in his sleep
A heart attack
At forty-six
The music magazines called him a hero in eulogy
The “Godfather of Puke”
I just thought he was lazy
And fat

When they finally let me back into your life
I felt like an old man
They needed work done on their houses
Or apartments
In exchange
“Would you make..”
“Could you paint..”
Sure I would say
I will do anything
To see you
I remember the drive through the woods to get to your condominium
Beech Drive
I thought of all my mountain bike rides
On the Rock Creek trails
Legs burning up
Brain on fire
With you constantly on my mind
When I arrived at your place
I got right to work
Smooth sailing
One time you greeted me at the door
“Hello Mister Fix Up Man”
They still had not told you
The simple truth

=~=~=The Terror of Sobriety=~=~=
Kissy was always drunk by ten
10am
He would have been drunk by nine
But the county liquor dispensary
Would not change their hours of operation
To accommodate all of his bitching
He bragged that he got more done by 9am
Than most men did all day
His wife usually chased him out of the house by noon
Told him to hit the road
One afternoon he came down my way
"My wife tells me I’m too mean to die"
"She’s right" he said and boasted some more
"I can out fuck out fight out drink any sonofabitch"
"Whatta bout you"
"Wanna sip"
He pulled a fifth of Canadian Mist from underneath the driver seat
And drank just about the whole bottle
Boy o boy
That guy sure could hold his own
I remember sitting in a bar a few months later telling some farm worker
How much of a bad-ass Kissy was
The farm worker
Finally realized who I was talking about
"Ju mean tu tell me ju didn ear"
He said
They found him in his car by one of the docks
Taking in a sunset
The means to an end
In his hand
Brains all over the dashboard
Kissy was 69

They nicknamed him “Crispy”
Like the sound and feel of newly issued hundred dollar bills
Those rascals at the surf shop would never shut up
About how disenfranchised their lives had been
In comparison to others
But it was Crispy
Who first showed me a skateboard
And turned me onto punk rock
When I was ten years old
I thought he was the coolest dude ever
But those rascals at the surf shop would not let it alone
About how Crispy lived in the gentrified part of Maryland
And not the quasi ghetto of Beecher Street with them and the rest of
Georgetown University’s alumni
I don’t think they had any idea
That Crispy came from a family of nine children
Perennially on Saturday morning
His mother and mine
Scoured every church bazaar and yard sale they could find
To put decent clothes on our backs
Crispy never wanted anyone to know his clothes were second hand
His astute dress and manner reflected this
Those two poorly attired rascals that teased him
Went on to become rock stars
Who bragged about all the skateboarding they did in junior high
They called other people posers
Who didn’t have their same
Coolness factor
Decades later
I can’t help but think that
Those rascals were the posers
Crispy was the real deal

Sitting on your grandmother’s
Wicker couch
In the living room
Feeling like an uninvited guest (perhaps I was)
At your third birthday party
It was the first time I had seen you in years
Not by choice
Twelve years later
I found a photograph your mother had snapped
Of me
Sitting there
Somehow feeling out of place
Watching you run around the living room
I felt invisible
A black hole
Ignored by all in attendance
Save for yourself
Too young to understand
Why they wanted it this way
It is hard to describe the way I felt

Not immediately anyway
Not after trying everything

To get him to face the music

He finally left town
For good
That’s what hurts now
No more waiting period
Or interval in between crossing his
Black cat path
Just gone
No sighting in
Oregon
Colorado
Or Amsterdam
Then
A rumor surfaced
That he was holed up with six vestal virgins
Somewhere on the island of Ko Chang
Just off the coast of Thailand
Binge drinking his way into paradise
Well
I’ll be a monkey’s uncle
He always did know how to party
Goodbye friend

Save a shot or scotch on the rocks for me
See you when
I retire
Give my regards to

We gazed at the art object
A heart tumbling through space
On fire
Battered and blue
Turning black
“What does it mean?” she asked
I explained that the black heart was not a bad thing
Not the harbinger of evil
Ridiculed in
Old wives tales
However
It was a symbol of temper
A process of hardening or toughening
The same way iron is smelted into steel
A trial by fire
Perhaps it was
The loss of love
Or a loved one
Burned in the inferno
A tacit understanding appeared in her eye
“How do you know the story of Blue Heart Burning Black?“
For a fleeting moment
Arose the bud
Of a memory
Long since forgotten
I held my tongue
Knowing that pain
Not remembered
Is pain
Left behind
In the spent ashes of a tempered soul

They had him laid out
On a hospital bed
All six foot five of him
The Sasquatch of Skateboarding
All jacked up
On morphine
“Is that you Monica?”
It wasn’t
It was Vivian
He was getting everyone mixed up
Several of his girlfriends had arrived
At the same time
Each thought she was the only one
His comments were delirious
“I jus luv you Monica”
I knew he was in deep trouble
Smiles were turning to frowns
I felt a catfight coming on
Just then the nurse came in
A sort of referee
“Visiting hours are over”
I walked around his feet
Sticking out from the edge of the bed
He had those silly hospital moccasins on
The girls were beginning to argue
About things jealous girls argue about
I guess he filled some pretty big shoes

Build him out of soft ribbons and bows
Someday he will walk out into this world

Hello I am this cornfield’s scarecrow
The unromantic character or so I am told
Won’t you run your fingers down my soft ribbons and bows
I would love to run away with you but it is here I set my soul

Wandering from town to town on my own two feet
Dreams lying naked between sheets
This time I was the scarecrow
Inside of a cornfield

When we will have to leave

The traveler says “Don’t sell your time to the man, man”
Wake up with the rooster
Get out on the open road
Run road runner run
Watch through the eye of the storm
See the dragon fly
Breathe volcano breathe
Watch the Sun God set
Rise full moon rise
I will dance under your moonlight sky

Tell all my frowning faces in the stranger’s town to go away

Going out bronze, lazy and insane
She said come sleep with me boy in the heart of a town where No One knows your name

=~=~=Tobacco Education=~=~=
The farm was way out
In the boonies
On the prime tobacco growing soils
Of Maryland
Known in centuries past for its good
Burning qualities
A small, independent farm that had somehow escaped
For generations
The clutches of usurping agribusiness companies
My father was working on his dissertation
Slavery In Maryland
We drove down the dirt lane
To where the farm house stood
A shack really
Built ages ago on the highest point of elevation
A man emerged
Black as the southern Maryland soil
My father talked to him for some time
As I sat in the car
The mid day sun was hot
I began to get thirsty
The farmer took us to his well
No electric pump
Only a bucket and ladle
I stood head level with the top of the cistern
He poured water into a glass
And handed it to me
Cold as ice
Before we left he gave my father a few green tobacco leaves to dry
My father was not much of a smoker
But was more interested in the tobacco drying process
From field to fire
A year or so later we returned to the tobacco farm
My father wanted to give the farmer a gift
This time the man invited us into his house
With the rest of his family
The wooden interior had a special warmth to it
We sat at the dining room table
In the center of the tiny room
As a sort of thank you for sharing his time
My father pulled a book from his pants pocket
And handed it to the farmer
The farmer stared in bewilderment at the cover of the paperback
Politely thanked my father
Then slowly set the book down on the table
My father looked somewhat faint
Color ran out of his pale face
As if he had abruptly come to some stark realization
Or barrier
Of written word
I felt a furrow opening up
Wide
Like a canyon
We said our goodbyes
On the way home I asked my father what the title of the book was
He muttered
History of Black Americans
Driving North
We fell silent
I could not yet read but still wondered why
My father gave him
A book of complicated words
Neither the farmer
Nor my father
Could ever understand

Pouring into deep blue eyes

Sewn together in a kiss

Bob’s face had become
Synonymous with the Georgetown Theater
The lines on his forehead
Engraved by decades of disingenuously using the words
“Thank you”
He worked the ticket booth
I was his apprentice
The ticket ripper
He tried
In earnest
To teach me the finer points of being a theater usher
The correct method of holding the door open
For patrons
And so forth
In 1961 he held the door open
For President Kennedy (“And his date--shhh!” Bob said this was confidential)
On Jack’s way in to see a live performance of the play
Death of a Salesman
This was the high point of his career
Five shows a day of the x-rated Roman epic
Caligula
Was the current fare
Even so
This was not enough to save the antiquated movie house
According to Bob
The theater
Had come a long way from its former glory
One winter day
Between shows
He told me the dreadful news
“Gus says they finally found a buyer.”
“They're gonna gut this place like a fish”
“And turn it into a jewelry outlet”
“Imagine that”
“The end of an empire”
Bob was getting pretty worked up
I detected a tear in his eye
“You don’t even seem to care!”
I just sat there
On the heater
Dressed up in the usher's red monkey suit
Looking through the large glass door
At cars passing by on Wisconsin Avenue
Wishing I was somewhere else
For once
Bob was right

Sometimes I feel I should just let it all go
Then again
I know
It’s nothing six thousand years of men
Haven’t had to face before
I’m going to stay strong
When I feel the fall
I’m going to hang on

There is a siren
Sitting on the other side of the lake
Singing her irresistible song
Wickedly tempting and inviting mistakes

Dripping wet outstretched arms
Tempestuously
Offering me seductive fruit
Then again
I know what I’ve got to do

The grass looks green on the other side
Then again
I know
It’s all in my mind
Coming to realize
Peripeteia
Paradise is found deceptively concealed
Quietly masquerading
As an ordinary thing
I stumble upon
At a seemingly uneventful
Time in my life
Goodbye dagger hiding behind an insidious smile
I have fortunately broken away

And within ten minutes
She dropped more names on me

Silent
Nodding every so often
Taking it all in
Trying not to look bored
I knew everyone she spoke of
Anyway
But didn’t let on
Besides
She was really getting into it
Her face was red and puffy
All worked up
The saga went on
And on
“…I think they’re getting married once the divorce is final”
And on
But here’s (in my opinion) where her thesis got complicated:
“...and she says he has to put that silly skateboard back in the closet”
“And spend more quality time with her, that’ll learn him. I couldn’t agree more!”
Boy oh boy

Cheer up mister man dans la lune
I've got a riddle for you:
Anyone who turned their back on love
Wouldn't shed his light on me
He would cower away from life
And sit sulking in a dimly lit room
Somewhere on the dark side of the moon

And that's not you
or me
Goodbye Dorothy

=~=~=Lost=~=~=
Write another song for me
When I’m gone
Rolling down the road
To no one ever knows

Jesus was just another lost soul
You met on your way
Somehow miscast in the play
Running away
Kicking around
Another loose stone on the ground

Girl we’re never going to make it
If we don’t try
Look into blue eyes
See Adam
See Eve
So much hardship and misery
You and me
And adversity
Our own personal trinity

=~=~=Living Lesson=~=~=
Wasted
Blown away
By the trials of life
Drugs
Alcohol
Divorce
More drugs
Things he wished he could
Forget
It had been over twenty years
Since I last saw him
A sadness
Or sense of loss
Filled his eyes
I talked about old times
And the days of yore
Wasted
In our misspent youth
“Remember when...”
I went on at length
About
All the beautiful
Girls in our high school class
Fist Fights
In the locker room
And the general mayhem
Associated with our adolescence
“Remember!”
He stared with tired eyes
Looking right through me
Because he couldn't recall
Twenty more years of
Backsliding down the road
Had not been kind
To his memory

=~=~=Little Sister=~=~=
Goodbye summertime
So long warm breeze
Whistling through my hair
Here comes the winter's
Killing freeze
Green fields are a frozen memory
Sleeping under a blanket of snow
Is it conceivable to die
I guess
Only the dead really know
Does it really matter anyway
If I ever knew you or you ever knew me
Only time will tell
A little piece
Of the puzzle in me
Written into you
Puts a little peace and wonder
Back into my heart
Will I ever see you again
Remember when you were
Running like a kite in the wind
I struggled to hold on and then
Something happened I still can't understand
You slipped right through my hands
Sweet snowflake
Whispering in my ear
Gently calling out from your falling star
Little Sister
Little Sister
All the while
The North wind blows
Goodbye summertime
Put a tear back in my eye
It's time to pick up sticks
And face the cold
Alone
%%end%%
=~=~=Penelope=~=~=
In trying to get back in touch with you
I felt so far
From Lovers Lane
The old familiar road
Of years ago
Is now a lost odyssey
A ragged joke with no more play
Knock Knock
“Just go away”
To say people change is clich'
Would you even recognize
Me

=~=~=Duck and Heron=~=~=
Duck and Heron
The nursery rhyme
And adult fairy tale
Sitting by the edge of the water
I am reminded of the
Meaningless stuff of
The old hermit in the woods
That lonely loveless man
Lacking in connection

Dashing knight of Sir Thomas Malory
Unable to see
The forest through the trees
Do you see the pretty girl
Caught in the snare of the city
Another lost snowy white egret
Pasted into the cold and dark landscape
Of relentless concrete

Duck and Heron
Together again
Sleeping on the edge of the bay
Beautiful white egret
Yearning to spread your wings
Dreaming of escape
If you are alone
Fly back toward me
Slip away
I am singing your song
Listen...
Can you hear me call

=~=~=The End of the Arc=~=~=
She was going a little berserk
Like most women do
In the morning
At the end of the month
So I walked out
Away from the turmoil
Into the cold city air
"Here's what you get!"
The spiteful message she sent
Specified that
Only a friendship could be salvaged
From the wreckage
Of our relationship
The love affair
So full of passion and life
Was now extinct
A fragile flower that had bloomed too soon
Met with a late spring freeze
And died
When I finally saw her again
I told her I already
Had enough friends
Shook her hand
And walked away
Back toward Lovers Lane
To spin the roulette wheel
One more time
Again

Where are you going with my heart
I’ll never tell you again

And the crazy way you move
Because I know
It is all I need to say

=~=~=Doubting Thomas=~=~=
He felt like he had gotten old
After tripping
Running for the ferryboat
Only to miss
Helplessly watching it roll on down
The river without him
An overwelming feeling
That somehow life had passed him
By
Came over him
Where was Saint Nick now
To tell him to quit whinning
And enjoy life
All his heroes had disappeared
While watching the river flow
The fat old man with the long grey
Beard
Sitting next to him on the pier
Sat back
Basking in the summer sun
Laughing
While the young man cried
The stout old man asked him
"Where do you think Santa Claus goes in the summer time?"

=~=~=The Great Depression=~=~=
What the stressed out
Cosmopolitan urban girl gave me
Would have killed another man
Her disease
Passed down
From a previous romantic
Catastrophe
Plagued her life with a dark
Sadness
I tried to help her
With laughter
Companionship
And a sympathetic ear
To listen to her rant
About her crummy
Office job
And the dodgy politics
Associated with it
About her millionaire ex-husband
Jilting her
And their messy divorce
About how she didn't know
What to do
With the rest of her
Insatiable life
Soon I was too close
To escape contracting
Her great depression
Of lonliness
Despair
And a fear of things to come
She passed it on
To me
Like a hot potato
I consumed it
And after our affair was over
What she gave me
Began to burn
And simmer
Inside
I had been had
Sold a clunker
At first the disease was
Manageable
Not a big deal
By the end I was bed ridden
And unable to sleep
Losing interest in things
Alone
With the neverending thought
That there was only darkness at
The end
Of the tunnel
My salvation came
At the hands of a small town
Country girl
Who offered the future
Of a simple life
Uncomplicated by the turmoil
Nonsense
And sickness
Of my past
Wise beyond her years
She wanted nothing in return

=~=~=Joyce's Modernist Portrait=~=~=
James Joyce’s <i>A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man</i>, Thomas Carlyle’s <i>Sartor Resartus</i> and Charles Bukowski’s <i>Factotum</i> all share autobiographical protagonists. In <i>A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man</i>, Joyce’s protagonist, Stephen Dedalus, searches for an escape from the confines of family, religion, Irish nationalism and poverty. Thomas Carlyle’s hero Diogenes Teufelsdrockh goes through cycles of despair eventually finding enlightenment. Charles Bukowski’s hero in his novel <i>Factotum</i>, Henry Chinaski, struggles with alcoholism, poverty and alienation from society. Carlyle’s novel was written during the Victorian era and Bukowski’s <i>Factotum</i> is centered in Los Angeles during the 1940’s. Joyce’s novel takes place around Dublin in the early 20th century. The characters of both Diogenes Teufelsdrockh and Henry Chinaski share many uncanny similarities with Joyce’s Modernist alter-ego, Stephen Dedalus. One of the biggest similarities these three characters share is their unconscious drive toward isolation and alienation from society in pursuit of artistry.

=~=~=The Age of Aquarius=~=~=
The hippie girl was right
Armageddon is here
She spoke with a cigarette
Dangling from her mouth
And a bandanna holding back
Her long jujubead hair-do
"It's totally here man.."
But she was right
Teams had been divided
Like a pick up soccer game
On a Sunday afternoon
Today you are either on the side of
Life, liberty
And the pursuit of happiness
Or at one with the kling-ons
Bent on destruction
Greed and
Self aggrandizement

Organic Food vs. Plastic Surgery
The hippie girl was right

Holding the pen he wrote:
The best don't write
About doing
When they have not done
About knowing
What they have not known
They write about
Isolation and
Alienation
From father
From brother
From daughter
They write about
Thoughts of suicide
And picking up pieces
Only to move on
They write about loving
When they have lost

He sighed
Then he sat back in his chair thinking:
Fuck it – the best don't write

=~=~=Cock and Bull=~=~=
He was so in love
But she was a stripper
He gave her everything
Cars
Money
His valuable spare time
And he followed her everywhere from
Washington to
California
While she pulled his short chain
All over the place
He even distanced himself
From his old friends
Because she told him they were fools
Very pussy-whipped (I know)
But she was just a stripper at heart
And when she dumped him
For another patron
He was so upset
Some time later
He found some photos
Of her online
Sobbing with his head in his hands he
Steadied himself in the folding chair
"I treated her so good!"
"Now her ass belongs to everyone"
"Look!"
He pointed at the computer monitor
And there she was
Scantly dressed
In a catholic school girl outfit
She was posing
With a big grin on her face
In a very compromising position
This was someone he had described
In the past as being
"Highly sophisticated"
I asked him if there was anything
To be gleaned from this
Horrific experience
He looked at me with tears streaming
Down his face
"Do you know what the worst thing About all this is?"
I sat and listened in bewilderment
"I'm never going to get another free lap dance again!"

=~=~=Race=~=~=
Doing all that doing
For the silly reason
Of getting ahead of the next man
Racing the race
Falling into line
With nothing left
To rebel against
We are grains of sand
Running around in the wind
Falling down
Then blowing back up again
Does it mean anything at all
Am I closer to the truth
If I know nothing at all

In a dream I saw you
At an Inaugural celebration
In Washington DC
The crowd pushed us toward

Each other

Until finally it was obvious
Who you were
You smiled and waved your hand
But connected with someone else
Behind me
It had been too long
And you did not remember
They had kept us apart for too long

Keep on rolling down river
Nothing is going to change today
Keep on rolling Old Man River
She's going to do what she does anyway

Creep on Casanova
You keep on pushing my love away
Keep on creeping down a long highway
Sometimes it's okay to run away

Laugh on all you lonely people
That will keep you from crying all day
Dead men are doornails forever
Lovers only live for today

Blue Sky
Please don't fade out on me
Thin line
Marking your way in life

Barking at the moon
Old man look back
At things lost in the fray
Maybe she will change her mind
Someday

We eke our way along
Just as the others did before
Crawling on our hands and knees
Until we eventually reach our feet
Out of this great stuggle
A thousand years from now
Something miraculous happens
Laughing
Crying
Evolving
Moving hand in hand
We finally discover
The sacred and timeless river
That runs through us together
Across eternity
Humankind is such an impressive
House of cards
How could we just
Blow it all away

=~=~=Symbolism and Hints of Autobiography in The Great Gatsby and Tender is the Night=~=~=
F. Scott Fitzgerald's <i>The Great Gatsby</i> and <i>Tender is the Night</i> share protagonists whose love affairs end in catastrophe. Jay Gatsby's romance with Daisy Buchanan shatters when Gatsby's platonic ideal of love collides with reality. Similarly, Dick Diver's romantic tryst, outside of marriage, hastens his downfall and descent into alcoholism. Fitzgerald's ideas about American decay in the aftermath of World War I are played through Jay Gatsby, and Dick Diver. Gatsby's endless desire for Daisy and his ideas about reliving a past that cannot be retrieved mirror the disillusionment of post-war America. Diver's desires for the young Rosemary Hoyt are benign so long as they are not acted upon. Fitzgerald's juxtaposition of the platonic ideals of love and the problems of actualizing love become enacted in the characters of Gatsby and Diver, especially in their yearnings to materialize what is outside space and time.

I finally turned off my TV
Pulled the plug for good
The local news channel
With the plastic anchor
And sexy advertisements
Was all snow
And Greek to me
Anyway
No antenna
No cable
No more digital revolution
All that yapping
About "important" stuff
Happening one too many miles
Down the road
Just made me feel
Left out of a world I didn't belong to
Anyway

=~=~=Totally Braille=~=~=
We conversed about how
Our dear friend and his wife
Had lost the plot
In life's storyline
The quest for them
Was no longer valid
"He says he doesn't have a choice"
I listened intently
"His wife is going to withhold sex
Until he takes that job
As a computer sales-exec
She wears the pants you know.."
He went on
"Besides..
Management made him an offer
His wife couldn't refuse
As 'employee in charge' of their
Equipment stocking warehouse
So now he has to quit slumming it
As a starving artist"
"Wow" I said scratching my head
Astonished at the monumental
Paradigm shift that
Had occurred in our friend's life
The discussion continued
"It's quite a trade off you know..
Everything was going along ok
Before they got married
But now she wants to buy into
The American dream
And become a Unitarian"
Still puzzled I said
"You mean utilitarian..
As in robot.. right?"
He nodded in acknowledgement
"Yeah whatever..I'm just letting you
Know that we've lost one of our own
To that faceless industrial wasteland
Again!"
In shock and horror I finally confessed:
"So much for pursuing the
Artistc Holy Grail"
He looked at me with understanding eyes
"Yeah--I guess love is blind but..
She must give some pretty
Amazing head too"
